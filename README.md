## Getting Started with the Front End

To start toying with the front end of the project, follow these steps:

1. Install React by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```
    npx create-react-app my-app
    ```

2. Install Node.js and NPM:
    - For macOS:
        - Download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
    - For Windows:
        - Download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
        - Make sure to select the option to install NPM during the installation process.

3. Install the necessary Node packages by navigating to the root directory of the project and running the following command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. Navigate to the FrontEnd/playpal directory using the following command:
    ```
    cd FrontEnd/playpal
    ```

5. Start the development server by running the following command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You can now start toying with the front end code.

Happy coding!
